## About hplonline

"hplonline" was my former cyber name. 

The colored version of logo:

![](images/logo/orig.jpg)

It was produced using Fireworks during my high school years. 

The grayscale version of logo:

![](images/logo/gray.jpg)

This is not the grayscaled logo used online before. 
Since I can not find it, I just used Imagick to convert one to present here. 
The one you saw from the Internet was also produced by Fireworks.

## About BaiduSpace

[BaiduSpace](http://hi.baidu.com) was once a clean blogging platform.
In the first few years, many OIers and ACMers had their blog on BaiduSpace. 
One advantage is its clean appearance (unlike QQ Space, which is overly decorated). 
The other advantage is that Baidu could be a trustworthy content host.
Over the years, BaiduSpace kept on losing behind, 
e.g. lack of tags, eat the sapce in you codes, etc. 
I was considering a migration to other platforms long ago. 
Due to the large amount of blog posts and images there, I could not manage it. 

## About hi.baidu.com/hplonline

The original link for this blog: <http://hi.baidu.com/hplonline>

In January of 2012, BaiduSpace shut down my blog!
It is a strange move:

   * I understand the content censorship in mainland China. 
   However, even if there is something improper, 
   the first thing to do is to make it non-public and ask the author to revise. 
   This is the norm of most service providers. 
   When my blog was shut down, even I myself can not see my posts and uploaded images. 
   * I appealed three times but only get a robot like response. 
   The customer service simply quote their terms of service:
   **do not use the blog for commercial purpose**!!! 
   That's insane!
   Everybody can see that I never used it for commercial purpose. 

What a guilty service provider!

**Keep away from BaiduSpace if you cherish your content**. 
They don't respect the authors. 

## About My Current Blogging

My [current blog](http://hupili.github.io) is built 
[using Jekyll](http://hupili.github.io/articles/site-building-using-Jekyll.html)
and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).

Give it a try and you'll never regret:

   * Jekyll community inherits all the good spirit from open source practice. 
   It is very easy to seek for a solution and get things done in a customized way. 
   * GitHub's quality of service is needless to say. 
   They are very quick to repond to any of your questions **by email**
   (not via a system where a bunch of robots quote ToS to reply the users). 

## The Purpose of This Blog

I accumulated 300K visits on BaiduSpace and most of them come from search engines. 
Those tech posts may still be useful to somebody. 
I repost them here to leave some searchable content on the Internet. 
Hope it can help others. 

Disclaimer:

   * Some of the technical statements turn out to be wrong when I look back now. 
   * Please keep a critical mind when you read those posts. 
   * If you can help to fix them by a Pull Request to 
   [the source dir](https://github.com/hupili/backup-hplonline/tree/master/source/_posts/tech.formatted), 
   I will be very glad to merge it.
